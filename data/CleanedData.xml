Lu belonged to the  Zhuang people Zhuang  ethnic group.  .        .    . 1992.  International Standard Book Number ISBN  9789575471835  Life    Late Qing Era   Lu Rongting was of peasant descent and joined secret societies during his youth in order to make a living. Lu became a regular of the Qing army after the outbreak of the  Sino-French War  in 1884. Between 1903 and 1905 he actively participated in the suppression of revolutionaries in Guangxi. In the fall of 1904  Viceroy of Liangguang   Cen Chunxuan  appointed Lu as the commander of the 4 thousand man Guangxi Border Guards. This army would later form the core of the  Guangxi Clique . In December 1907  Long Jiguang  and Lu Rongting led the Qing forces in suppressing the  Zhennanguan Uprising . The successful suppression of the revolt led by  Sun Yat-sen  and  Huang Xing  consequently drove Sun to flee to Singapore and did not return to China till the  Wuchang Uprising . reference here The Qing court awarded Lu with the  Baturu  title. With Long Jiguang leaving for the position of Viceroy of  Guangdong  Lu was promoted to become the Viceroy of  Guangxi .   Leader of the Old Guangxi Clique   In July 1911 following the  Wuchang Uprising  Guangxi governor  Shen Bingkun  proclaimed independence and formed the Guangxi military government. Following the departure of  Shen Bingkun  and  Wang Zhixiang  Lu assumed control over the Guangxi province. On 8 February 1912 Yuanshi Kai formally appointed Lu as the Governor of Guangxi. In the  Kuomintang GMD  initiated  History of the Kuomintang second revolution  in 1913 Lu sided with Yuan Shikai and suppressed the Nationalist revolutionaries in Guangxi. Soon after  Cai E  and  Tang Jiyao  Yunnan Clique started the  National Protection War  and Lu joined the side of Cai and Tang against Yuan s monarchial ambitions. In the process  Cen Chunxuan  an enemy of Yuan Shikai was secretly recruited by Lu. Some scholars has suggested the reason for Lu s sudden change in allegiance may be due to his discontent towards Yuan s preferential treatment which prevented Lu from expanding his influence into Guangdong.              1993 53-55  Nevertheless the National Protection War led to the abdication of Yuan Shikai.  Long Jiguang  proclaimed Guangdong s independence from Yuan on 6 April 1916. With the death of Yuan Shikai in June Lu and  Li Liejun  attacked Long and forced Long to retreat to  Hainan . In the same year Lu assumed the governor of Guangdong province. Lu s control and jurisdiction over both Guangdong and Guangxi was affirmed by  Li Yuanhong  in April 1917.   Start of the Warlord Era    File:Lu Rongting1.jpg thumb 241x241px Lu s gift to RFC Hedgeland dated 19 October 1919. Caption reads: Lu Jung-T ing Governor General and Commander in Chief of Guangdong and Guangxi Canton  Sun Yat-sen initiated the  Constitutional Protection Movement  in 1917 and Lu played an important role. Under the military reorganization in 1918 Tang Jihao and Lu were appointed joint-chiefs. This organization took part in establishing peace between the Beijing government Under the  Zhili Clique  and the Constitutional Protection Movement armies. However schisms within the movement took place with Sun opposing against Lu s  Old Guangxi Clique  nuanced stance against the Zhili Clique led government in  Beijing . Furthermore the people of Guangdong were gradually in antipathy towards Lu s control over the province. By July 1920  Chen Jiongming  with Sun s support  ousted Lu and  Cen Chunxuan  from Guangdong.   Military Comeback   After Lu s loss in Guangdong he gained the support of the  Beiyang government  in an attempt to recover the province. In June 1921 the second conflict between the  Old Guangxi Clique  and the  Kwantung Army  took place. With defections within his own army and loss of strategic city  Chongzuo  in September Lu declared his decision to step down from governor in  Nanning  and subsequently fleeing to Shanghai. Due to the polarization of relations between  Chen Jiongming  and  Sun Yat-sen  Lu was re-appointed to become the governor of the Guangxi province in 1923 by the Beiyang government. However he was unable to fully recover his influence over the province due the formation of the  New Guangxi Clique  led by  Li Zongren  and  Bai Chongxi . Within Southern China three forces emerged the most powerful led by the coalition of Lu and followed by  Shen Hongying  and the New Guangxi Clique. In 1924 Lu s forces was surrounded by Shen s forces and at the same time was under the attack of the New Guangxi Clique. Nanning  was lost the  New Guangxi Clique  and by August of the same year Lu had also conceded  Guilin  to Shen. Facing defeat Lu fled to  Yongzhou  Hunan and officially announced his departure from politics and defeat on 9 October 1924.          1  59-74            76  Following which Lu Rongting retired from politics.

Other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.  Social development  Social deficits distinguish autism and the related  autism spectrum disorder s ASD see  Classification Classification  from other developmental disorders.

Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from  social norms  for example they have less  eye contact  and  turn-taking  and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things.

Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply.

Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Compulsive behavior   is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.   Sameness  is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.

The first category focuses on deficits in  social cognition .  Simon Baron-Cohen  s  empathizing systemizing theory  postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen s earlier  theory of mind  approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the  Sally Anne test  for reasoning about others motivations  cite journal  vauthors  Baron-Cohen S  title  Autism: the empathizing systemizing E-S theory  journal  Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences  volume  1156  pages  68 80  year  2009  pmid  19338503  doi  10.1111 j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x  url  http: docs.autismresearchcentre.com papers 2009 BC nyas.pdf  format  PDF  archiveurl  https: web.archive.org web 20131214134422 http: docs.autismresearchcentre.com papers 2009 BC nyas.pdf  archivedate  14 December 2013  and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in   Pathophysiology Pathophysiology   maps well to the hypothesis.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms.

No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment.

My use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy class and State interchangeably as many social theorists do is insidious and obscurantist. This practice in the name of a classless or libertarian society could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life according to individual desires tastes and inclinations.  Emma Goldman . What it Really Stands for Anarchy in   Anarchism and Other Essays  .Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left  follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism ... Authority takes many shapes but broadly speaking her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress opposing her openly avowedly sincerely consistently universally second those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world third those who distrust her as a means of progress believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon violating and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy of the second in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy of the third in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.

Indeed we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission. http: theanarchistlibrary.org library saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination   Saul Newman  The radical  Protestant Christianity Protestant Christian   Gerrard Winstanley  and his group the  Diggers  are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.

Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving.

The  Paris Commune  was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March more formally from 28 March to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune.

As for the reforms initiated by the Commune such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ... Moreover the Commune s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Proudhon  on French radical ideas. Indeed the Commune s vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin s and Proudhon s ideas Proudhon like Bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in 1848 ... and for federation of communes .

The dismemberment of the French  socialist movement  into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871  Paris Commune  the execution and exile of many   communards   to  penal colonies  favoured individualist political expression and acts.Historian  Benedict Anderson  thus writes: In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then  Adolphe Thiers Versailles  seized the moment to attack and in one horrifying week executed roughly 20 000 Communards or suspected sympathizers a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during  Robespierre  s  Reign of Terror Terror  of 1793 1794. More than 7 500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium England Italy Spain and the United States. In 1872 stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce  Napoleon III of France Louis Napoleon  s imperialist expansion  in Indochina Africa and Oceania. Many of France s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune  Gustave Courbet Courbet  was its quasi-minister of culture  Arthur Rimbaud Rimbaud  and  Pissarro  were active propagandists or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.  in  cite news author Benedict Anderson title In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel publisher  New Left Review  date July August 2004 url http: newleftreview.org view 2519  According to some analysts in  History of Germany since 1945 post-war Germany  the prohibition of the  Communist Party of Germany Communist Party  KDP and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also in the same manner have played a role in the creation of the  Red Army Faction .

It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions then business transactions alone produce the social order.  It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service. Mutualist anarchism is concerned with  Reciprocity cultural anthropology reciprocity  free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform.

Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or   propaganda by the deed   which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production. However collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by  anarchist communists  as effectively uphold ing the wages system . cite book last Kropotkin first Peter title The Conquest of Bread publisher AK Press location Edinburgh year 2007 chapter 13 isbn 978-1-904859-10-9  Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with  Marxism  but opposed the Marxist  dictatorship of the proletariat  despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. cite book last Bakunin first Mikhail title Statism and Anarchy publisher Cambridge University Press location Cambridge year 1990 isbn 0-521-36182-6 quote They the Marxists maintain that only a dictatorship  their dictatorship of course  can create the will of the people while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it freedom can be created only by freedom that is by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.

And markets properly understood have always been about cooperation.

There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an  anti-capitalist  movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms. The philosophy of anarcho-capitalism dreamed up by the libertarian  New Right  has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.

The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism  minimal statism and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words libertarian and libertarianism . It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their  right libertarianism  and the  left libertarianism  of the anarchist tradition.  Anarchist seeds beneath the snow: left libertarian thought and british writers from William Morris to Colin Ward  by David Goodway. Liverpool University Press. Liverpool. 2006. p. 4 Within Libertarianism Rothbard represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Rothbard s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states with each person supplying their own police force army and law or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum the anarchy of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud. http: theanarchistlibrary.org library peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy by Peter Sabatini in issue 41 Fall Winter 1994 95 of   Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed    Internal issues and debates   See also Anarchism and violence Anarchist schools of thought Issues in anarchism   File:Gadewar.jpg thumb left Which forms of violence if any are  anarchism and violence consistent with anarchist values  is a controversial subject among anarchists.

Education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary .
